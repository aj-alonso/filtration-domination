# Filtration-domination algorithms
Copyright 2022 TU Graz

## Summary

The present code implements algorithms to remove edges from a bifiltered graph,
while maintaining the topological properties of its clique complex. An
explanation of these terms, and a description of the algorithms, are in the
paper

"Filtration-Domination in Bifiltered Graphs"
by Ángel Javier Alonso, Michael Kerber, and Siddharth Pritam.

The code also includes utilities to handle bifiltered graphs, compute its clique
complexes, and run mpfree. See the documentation below.

This is a Rust project. It has been tested with Rust 1.60. Below, we use
`cargo`, which is the Rust package manager.

## Usage

The API has two main functions: `remove_filtration_dominated` and
`remove_strongly_filtration_dominated`, both in the `removal` module, which
directly correspond to the described algorithms in the paper. They take as input
a list of (bifiltered) edges, encoded as an ``EdgeList``, and output a reduced
list of edges.

## Tests

Run the tests with
```shell
cargo test --release
```
It expects that the datasets are available in the `datasets` directory.
Use the provided script `download_datasets.sh` to download them.
It is required that the `mpfree` executable is available in the PATH.

## Example

There is an example in `examples/run.rs`. It can be run with
```shell
cargo run --release --example run -- senate
```
where `senate` can be any of the available datasets.

Passing the `-m` option to the example
computes a minimal presentation with mpfree; run it as follows:
```shell
cargo run --release --example run -- senate -m
```

You can also pass the `--strong` option to use the strong filtration-dominated
removal algorithm, instead of the non-strong one, which is the default in this
example.
